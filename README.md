# Summary

OPENCS is an open source computer science curriculum. This program is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors from top universities. All courses included in this program, originate from the world's top educational institutions in the field of computer science, such as Harvard and University of Helsinki.

The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Intro CS*: giving a basic but broad overview of the computer science spectrum.
- *Core CS*: classes that all computer science majors would require to take.
- *Specialization CS*: a specialization in software engineering.

Within the curriculum we chose to focus primarily on Java and Python as the used programming languages.
